# React for streamElements

- I just start the project late at night so it's not ready (Check TODO)
- You can ask for some feature in the issue section with the enhancement label.
- If you want contribute to the project, go for it!

## How to import to streamElements

- HTML: Copy `build/static/index.html` for the HTML section
- JS: Copy only `build/static/js/bundle.min.js` for the javascript section
- CSS: Copy `build/static/css/bundle.min.css` for the css section
- Image: Don't worry buddy, images are inline into base64. (Nothing to do)

## Nice packages integrated

- Make simple and nice animation with: [react-animated-css](https://github.com/digital-flowers/react-animated-css#readme)

## TODO

- Simulate data
- Simulate onWidgetLoad
- Simulate onEventReceived (API)
