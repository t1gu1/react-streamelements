# React for streamElements

- I just start the project late at night so it's not ready (Check TODO)
- You can ask for some feature in the issue section with the enhancement label.
- If you want contribute to the project, go for it!

## How to import to streamElements

- Copy `build/static/index.html` for the HTML section
- Copy `build/static/js/bundle.min.js` for the javascript section
- Copy `build/static/css/bundle.min.css` for the css section
- Media: Not working right now. (I'll try to inline them in base64)

## TODO

- Inline images as base64
- Simulate data
- Simulate onWidgetLoad
- Simulate onEventReceived (API)
